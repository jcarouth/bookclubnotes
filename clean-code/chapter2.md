# Chapter 2: Meaningful Names

## Observations

- Beware of naming things with established contexts. Example accountList. Is it a list or is a collection of accounts?
- Number series naming is the opposite of intentional. It is noninformative. It does not give clues to the author's intent.
- Distinguish names in such a way that the reader understands the distinction each offers.
- "If you can't pronounce it, you cannot discuss it without sounding like an idiot...Programming is a social activity."
- One difference between a smart programmer and a professional programmer is that the professional understands clarity is king. The professional writes code others can understand.
- Do you know what the function HolyHandGrendate() does?
- Choosing technical names for technical things is the way to go. What programmer wouldn't know what a JobQueue does?
- Use names from the solution space when appropriate. Developers shouldn't have to run back to the customer every time they read a variable name.
- Shorter names are generally better than longer ones. Add no more context to a name than is necessary.

## What I'm going to do

- Surprise your co-workers by renaming things following these guidelines. You might meet some resistance but it will pay off in the long run.
