# Chapter 1: Clean Code

## Observations

- Code can be classified as good code or bad code. There is the idea of transformation from bad to good. The goal of this book is to help you become a better programmer and teach you to recognize the difference between good and bad code and how to transform code.
- Code is representative of the details of the requirements. Specification to the point where a computer can execute the requirements is programming, is code.
- Programmers are required to be able to translate vaguely specified needs into perfectly executing programs that precisely meet those needs. An impossible task.
- Bad code is difficult to maintain. Bad code can stretch release cycles, make bugs difficult to impossible to squash, and even close down business.
- Adding more and more features can lead to unmanageable projects. Code can bring your company down.
- Wading through bad code. "We slog through a morass of tangled brambles and hidden pitfalls."
- Think about the Total Cost of Ownership of a messy codebase. As the mess builds productiving approaches zero. Management adds more developers. More messes are created.
- Is it the fault of changing requirements? Or tight deadlines? No. It is our fault. It is unprofessional to create and leave messes.
- Management looks to developers for information they need to make promises and commitments. It is our job to make sure this happens.
- Writing clean code is like painting a picture. It's easy to recognize good art from bad art, but that doesn't mean you know how to paint.
- Develop code-sense. Code-sense allows you to look at mess and see options and variations that will guide you to the transformations needed to clean up the mess.

- Bjarne Stroustrup says clean code does one thing well. It is elegant and efficient so as to not tempt people to make it messy. Think of broken windows from Pragmatic Programmer.
- Clean code should be readable, understandable. Readable by other developers.
- Michael Feathres says clean code is appreciable and shows care.

- Follow the Boy Scout Rule. If we all check in our code a little cleaner than when we checked it out, code will not rot. Imagine working on a codebase where code gets better over time.
