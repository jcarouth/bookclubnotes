# Book Club Notes

As a participant in the [Dev Book Club](http://devbookclub.org) I will keep notes from chapters as I read in this repository.

#### Clean Code by Robert Martin

The Book club started covering this book on February 3, 2015. My notes from this book are in [clean-code](clean-code).

[Joe Ferguson](https://twitter.com/joepferguson) is also tracking his notes in his [CleanCode-BookNotes](https://github.com/svpernova09/CleanCode-BookNotes) repository.
